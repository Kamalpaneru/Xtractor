# Xtractor

Xtractor was developed as a need to my own problem of inserting handwritten data from an excelsheet image to excel.And it does the same as described.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xtractor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xtractor

## Usage

Used to split cells from excel sheet images and extracts data. <br>
  NOTE: Tesseract didn't work as smoothly as I imagined it to be.<br> <br>

  ```ruby
    require 'xtractor'

    Xtractor::Execute.new('Image_Filename').start

  ```
